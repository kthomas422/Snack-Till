# Snack-Till

A simple till application I wrote for a hotel I use to work at.

Keeps track of how many items were sold and how much cash should have been taken in.
Also calculates change needed to be given to customer.

The "main" program is snack_till.pyw that the sales are made from and saves the data to a csv file. 
There is a manage_till.pyw that saves the csv report to a defined location and the numbers can be reset from that screen as well.
